                Whales are amazing creatures, huge, really huge, but totally harmless. At least the blue whales. The
                true scale of these giants is very difficult to imagine even from photographs - until you see them in
                person,
                you are unlikely to be able to feel the greatness of these creatures. The seasonal migration of whales
                is an amazing spectacle that attracts many tourists to some countries in Oceania.

            <h2>Blue whales are the biggest animals</h2>
            <p>
                The body length of an adult whale of this species can reach 33 meters, and its weight can exceed 150
                tons.

            <h2>Whales are descended from land-living cloven-hoofed mammals</h2>
            <p>This evolutionary leap happened about 54 million years ago. They still have fur on their huge bodies, are
                warm-blooded, and feed their offspring with milk.</p>

            <h2>The heart of the blue whale is the largest in the world</h2>
            <p>It weighs about a ton. This is much larger than the heart of an elephant, the largest land creature</p>
